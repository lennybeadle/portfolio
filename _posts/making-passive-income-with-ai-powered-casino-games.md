# Revolutionizing Online Gambling with RPSBET.IO's Peer-to-Peer Platform

**RPSBET.IO** is transforming the online gambling industry with its unique peer-to-peer platform built on blockchain technology. Unlike traditional online casinos, RPSBET.IO allows players to become the house and earn passive income from the casino's established and profitable business model. By utilizing blockchain technology, RPSBET.IO offers a decentralized and transparent platform for online betting, providing a safe and fair experience for all users. Additionally, RPSBET.IO has the potential to circumvent existing restrictions and regulations in many parts of the world, opening up new opportunities for online gambling. If you're interested in the future of online gambling and the potential of blockchain technology, consider RPSBET.IO as a promising investment opportunity.

## How it Works

RPSBET.IO's peer-to-peer skill betting protocol offers a transparent and secure process for online gambling. Understanding the protocol is key to grasping how the platform operates.

1. Any user creates a cash game from any of the various games available on the platform. Creating the bet requires putting up tokens to create a “pool” (HOLD above). The creator of the bet completes the game and the results are stored for others to compete/bet against.

2. Others can also create their own bets or can select from already created bets to play against. If selecting to play against an existing bet, the user bets their tokens against the “pool”, and adds/takes away from the “pool” by losing/winning.

3. As users join bets, the “pool” grows or gets smaller as people win and lose. The creator of the game can cancel the stake at any time and withdraw their liquidity “pool” out at a loss or a profit but if they have set an automatic payout, they will infinitely receive payouts should the game they customized on set up be profitable (depends on the settings they set).

### Skill Games and the advancement of AI

Contrary to popular belief, gambling is not always an impossible risk. At RPSBET.IO, we are committed to providing a user-first online betting experience. To achieve this, we utilize sophisticated AI algorithms, including Markov models, to create skill-based games that minimize the role of chance and randomness. Our goal is to provide games that offer a level playing field for all users, where success is determined by skill and strategy rather than luck. By leveraging AI algorithms to analyze gameplay data and create new games, we are able to constantly refine and improve our offerings to ensure the highest level of control-rate and skill-based competition. With RPSBET.IO, you can trust that you are playing in an environment where your skills and strategy truly matter. Our core values remain user-first, a focus on efficiency and reduced risk to as close to zero as possible.

We're implementing our concepts with simple games to begin with.

#### The Prediction Algorithm

```jsx
const predictNext = (prevStates, rps_list) => {
  // Create a transition matrix to store the probability of transitioning from one state to another
  const transitionMatrix = {
    R: { R: { R: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, P: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, S: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 } }, P: { R: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, P: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, S: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 } }, S: { R: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, P: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, S: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 } } },
    P: { R: { R: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, P: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, S: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 } }, P: { R: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, P: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, S: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 } }, S: { R: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, P: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, S: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 } } },
    S: { R: { R: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, P: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, S: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 } }, P: { R: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, P: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, S: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 } }, S: { R: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, P: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 }, S: { R: 0, P: 0, S: 0 } } },
  };

  // Iterate through the previous states to populate the transition matrix
  for (let i = 0; i < prevStates.length - 3; i++) {
    transitionMatrix[prevStates[i].rps][prevStates[i + 1].rps][prevStates[i + 2].rps][prevStates[i + 3].rps]++;
  }

  // Normalize the transition matrix
  Object.keys(transitionMatrix).forEach((fromState1) => {
    Object.keys(transitionMatrix[fromState1]).forEach((fromState2) => {
      Object.keys(transitionMatrix[fromState1][fromState2]).forEach((fromState3) => {
        const totalTransitions = Object.values(transitionMatrix[fromState1][fromState2][fromState3]).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
        Object.keys(transitionMatrix[fromState1][fromState2][fromState3]).forEach((toState) => {
          transitionMatrix[fromState1][fromState2][fromState3][toState] /= totalTransitions;
        });
      });
    });
  });

  // Check for consistency
  const winChance = calcWinChance(rps_list);
  let deviation = 0;
  if (winChance !== "33.33%") {
      deviation = (1 - (1 / 3)) / 2;
  }
  // Use the transition matrix to predict the next state based on the current state
  let currentState1 = prevStates[prevStates.length - 3].rps;
  let currentState2 = prevStates[prevStates.length - 2].rps;
  let currentState3 = prevStates[prevStates.length - 1].rps;
  let nextState = currentState3;
  let maxProb = 0;
  Object.keys(transitionMatrix[currentState1][currentState2][currentState3]).forEach((state) => {
    if (transitionMatrix[currentState1][currentState2][currentState3][state] > maxProb) {
      maxProb = transitionMatrix[currentState1][currentState2][currentState3][state];
      nextState = state;
    }
  });

	// Add randomness
  let randomNum = Math.random();
  if (randomNum < deviation) {
    let randomState = '';
    do {
      randomNum = Math.random();
      if (randomNum < (1 / 3)) {
        randomState = 'R';
      } else if (randomNum < (2 / 3)) {
        randomState = 'P';
      } else {
        randomState = 'S';
      }

    } while ( randomState === currentState3 );
    nextState = randomState;
  }
  return nextState;
}
```

## Founder's Note

> It should not take so many years to be financially free. It's not impossible to make it much quicker with less experience. It's going to be tough to reach the goals we strive for but with times constantly changing, we see AI being used for making passive income, if we're thinking logically. Of course, it's not for everyone. Like any investment, it requires initial capital you are willing to lose, but if you can acquire some basic funds, you can quite easily make passive income with our gaming software.
